# Unicode Decompose

A little site that decomposes input into it's constituent Unicode characters.

See it live at [fill-me-in](todo).

## Maintenance

When a new `UnicodeData.txt` is released by the Unicode folks, we need to update this site. To do
so, update the URL in `packages/update-names/index.ts` and then run `npm run update-names`.
